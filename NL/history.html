        <h4>The Newfoundland dog</h4>

        <p>The Newfoundland dog and Newfoundland pony 
        are well-known symbols of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
        </p>
      
        <p>
        The Newfoundland dog is famed for its bravery, gentle temperament and strong swimming abilities. 
        It has a stiff, oily outer coat and a fleecy undercoat that allows it to adapt to harsh, wet conditions.
        Because of their physique, Newfoundland dogs were frequent companions aboard fishing vessels, 
        where they helped to haul nets, and retrieve objects and persons from the water. 
        Because of their size and their life-saving instincts, they can easily pull drowning persons to safety.
        Their lung capacity enables them to swim long distances while fighting powerful ocean currents.  
        </p>

        <p>
        Newfoundland dogs have proven to be useful on land as well. 
        Capable of pulling heavy loads, they were historically hitched to carts loaded with fish, milk and mail.

        <p>
          Italian explorer, John Cabot, is famed for discovering Newfoundland and was instrumental
           in the development of the transatlantic trade between England and the Americas.    
        </p>
        <p>
         Although not born in England, John Cabot led English ships on voyages of discovery in Tudor times. 
         John Cabot (about 1450â€“98) was an experienced Italian seafarer who came to live in England during the reign of Henry VII.
        In 1497 he sailed west from Bristol hoping to find a shorter route to Asia,
        a land believed to be rich in gold, spices and other luxuries. After a month, 
        he discovered a 'new found land', today known as Newfoundland in Canada. 
        Cabot is credited for claiming North America for England and kick-starting 
        a century of English transatlantic exploration.
