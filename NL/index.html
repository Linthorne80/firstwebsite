    <h4>Geographical Information</h4>

   <p> <span class="firstc">T</span>

   </p> 

   <h4>Exploration History</h4>

   <p>
    The  first  European  contact  with North  America  was  that  of  the  medieval Norsesettlers arriving via Greenland.  
    </p>
   
    <p>
    For  several  years  after  AD  1000  they  lived  in  a  village  on  the  tip  of  the  Great  Northern Peninsula,  known  today  asL'Anse  aux  Meadows. 
    Remnants  and  artifacts  of  the  occupation  can  still  be seen  at  L'Anse  aux  Meadows,  now  a  UNESCOWorld  Heritage  Site.  The  island  was  
    inhabited  by theBeothuk (known asskrælingjarinGreenlandic Norse) and later by Mi'kmaq.
    </p>

    <p>
    From the late 15th Century, European explorers likeJohn Cabot,
    João Fernandes Lavrador,Gaspar Corte-Real,Jacques Cartierand others began exploration. 
    </p>

    <p>
    John Cabot(1450 – 1499), commissioned by King Henry VII ofEngland, landed on the North East coast of North  America  in  1497. 
    The  exact  location  of  his  landing  is  unknown  but  the 500th  anniversary  of  his landing   was   commemorated   inBonavista.   
    The   1497   voyage   has   generated   muchdebateamong historians,  with  various  points  in  Newfoundland,  and  Cape  Breton  Island  in  Nova  Scotia, 
    most  often identified as the likely landing place.

    <p>
      
      Although it was not declared the provincial flower of Newfoundland and Labrador until 1954, 
    this strange plant appeared on the Newfoundland penny during the late 1880s.  
    The <a href="www.lanephotography.com/pitcher_plant/pitcher.htm"target="_blank">pitcher plant</a>
     is found primarily in bogs and marshland
    throughout the province. It has a large wine-red flower and hollow pitcher-shaped leaves  are  attached  to  the  base  of  the  stem. 
     An  insectivorous  plant,  it  feeds  off  insects  that  become trapped inside when the leaves fill with water.

     <p>
      
     Designated as the provincial tree in November 1993, it is also known as the bog spruce. 
     Although dark bluish-green in colour, it is called the "black" spruce to distinguish it from other types of spruce trees.
      An evergreen  coniferous  tree,  
     it  is  tolerant  of  nutrient-deficient  soils,  growing  primarily  in  areas that  have poor drainage.  
     The <a href=" www.borealforest.org/trees/tree7.htm"target="_blank">black spruce </a> is the most abundant 
     tree in Labrador and appears on the Labrador flag.

     <p>
    
     The <a href="www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?pid=1&id=26&cid=7"target="_blank">puffin</a> has officially been the provincial bird of Newfoundland and Labrador since 1991. 
     It is a member of the auk family. The puffin is also called the sea parrot because of its multi-coloured beak.
    Marine birds that inhabit cliffs, puffins can dive 50 metres underwater in searchof food. 
    Their diet consists mostly of small fish such as caplin and herring.  Their wingspan is approximately 55 cm., and they can fly up to 80 km.  per  hour.  
    They  live  approximately  25  years,  usually  mate  for  life,  and  produce  one  egg  per  year. 
    Witless Bay, Newfoundland, is home to the largest puffin colony in North America.

     <P>
    A mineral discovered in northern Labrador, it was first described by Moravian missionaries in the late 18th century and brought to Europe.  
     It is prized for its beautiful shifting iridescent colours of blue, green, grey and bronze.  
     Found largely in the Nain area of Labrador, it is being mined at Ten Mile Bay by the Labrador Inuit Association.  
     <a href="/minerals/silicate/labrador/labrador.htm"target="_blank">Labradorite</a>

     The provincial tartan was developed in 1955 by Sam Wilansky, a clothing store owner in St. John's. 
     The tartan  is  predominantly  green  with  gold,  white,  brown  and  red  bands  of  colour.  
     He  chose  most  of  the coloursto correspond with
